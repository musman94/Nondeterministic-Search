# Nondeterministic Search
The code solves the following puzzle using Nondeterministic Search:          
Three soldiers have to cross a river without a bridge. Two boys with a boat agree to help the soldiers, but the boat is so small it can support only one soldier or two boys. A soldier and a boy can't be in the boat at the same time for fear of sinking it. Given that none of the soldiers can swim, it would seem that in these circumstances just one soldier could cross the river. Yet all three soldiers eventually end up on the other bank and return the boat to the boys. How do they do it?
